Run Commuter Houston
======
**Run Commuter Houston** is an app for runners in Houston who have to supplement thier trip with the bus. 

Run commuting is gaining in popularity. But the limiting factors of running to work include traveling longer distances than is reasonable to run. Taking the bus is a great way around this. 

**Run Commuter Houston** is a mobile iOS app built in Swift 3 that allows commuters to get information on the bus stops closest to them.

## How-to use this code
I'm working on getting it to run on [Appetize.io](https://appetize.io/app/9m3bhtgbwgfwvupdwvgw6qpcfc?device=iphone6s&scale=75&orientation=portrait&osVersion=9.2) but am not yet successful with that.

I suggest cloning this repo to a mac with Xcode and run the app in the simulator. If you have difficulty, please reach out to me at 713-557-8048.
