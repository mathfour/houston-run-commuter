Run Commuter Houston
======
**Run Commuter Houston** is an app for runners in Houston who have to supplement thier trip with the bus. 

Run commuting is gaining in popularity. But the limiting factors of running to work include traveling longer distances than is reasonable to run. Taking the bus is a great way around this. 

**Run Commuter Houston** is a mobile iOS app built in Swift 3 that allows commuters to get information on the bus stops closest to them.
